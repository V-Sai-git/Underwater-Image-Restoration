# Underwater-Image-Restoration-Using-Machine-Learning

This repository presents a fine-tuned Residual-UNet augmented with Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) for underwater image restoration. 
The model leverages lightweight channel attention and HardSwish activations to efficiently correct color distortions and recover features with fewer parameters. 
Trained on the LSUI benchmark, it achieves SSIM = 0.9998 and PSNR = 74.851 dB, outperforming prior methods by â‰ˆ4%.
